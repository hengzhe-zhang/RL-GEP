This :mod:`symbol` module defines the classes encapsulating the symbols in GEP. A gene in GEP is composed of multiple
symbols,  which include *terminals* and *functions*. Together, they are called *primitives*. This module also
provides a :class:`PrimitiveSet` class, which represents a primitive set containing :class:`Terminal`
and :class:`Function` items, for management purpose.

This module implementation refers a lot to the
`deap.gp <http://deap.readthedocs.io/en/master/tutorials/advanced/gp.html>`_ module in DEAP,
especially on primitive management and parsing during evaluation. However, unlike genetic programming (GP) in
:mod:`deap.gp`, in GEP we usually only consider loosely  typed evolution, i.e., the terminals and functions don't
require specific data types. As a result, the codes can be greatly simplified.

.. note::
    In GEP and GP terminology, there are two kinds of primitives: *functions* and *terminals*. In
    `deap.gp <http://deap.readthedocs.io/en/master/tutorials/advanced/gp.html>`_, a *primitive* actually refers to
    a function. To avoid possible ambiguity, in :mod:`geppy` they are explicitly named *function* and *terminal*
    respectively. For instance, the :meth:`PrimitiveSet.add_function` method can be used to add a function primitive.
