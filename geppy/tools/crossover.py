The module :mod:`crossover` provides crossover (mating, recombination) related genetic modifications in GEP,
including one-point and two-point crossover, and gene crossover between multigenic chromosomes.
Please refer to Chapter 3 of [FC2006]_ for more details.

.. note::
    All the recombination operators including :func:`crossover_one_point`, :func:`crossover_two_point`, and
    :func:`crossover_gene` can be applied to both :class:`~geppy.core.entity.Gene`
    and :class:`~geppy.core.entity.GeneDc`.
